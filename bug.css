The following CSS code snippet demonstrates a common issue:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

This code will cause the `div` elements to float and potentially overlap if the parent container isn't cleared properly, resulting in unexpected layout.  The issue is less about a specific error message but rather an unexpected visual outcome.
