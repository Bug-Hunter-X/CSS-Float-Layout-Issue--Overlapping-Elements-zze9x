The following CSS snippet demonstrates a clearfix solution:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}

/* clearfix solution */
.clearfix::after {
  content: "";
  clear: both;
  display: table;
}
```

By adding a `.clearfix` class to the parent container and applying the clearfix technique, the parent container will accurately wrap around the floated elements, ensuring the correct layout.
